##Submission
This was our submission to Studenthack 2019. It was meant to be a version of spaceteam using ARM microbits. It didn't work cause of the limited time we had but mainly because it is difficult for these chips to communicate. I still think it would be very fun to make it work and if I am ever at another hack with microbits I will give it a go.
